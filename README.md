# ProGrad Lab | Angular Layout

# Learning Goals

After this lesson, you will be able to:

- Create a static Angular application with Angular CLI.
- Build an Angular application with multiple components.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo.
- Clone this repo.

## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```

Navigate to your repo and create a pull request from your master branch to the original repository's master branch.

In the pull request name, add your Prograd id, name, and last name separated by a dash "-".

## Deliverables

You need to generate the starter code and fill it with the necessary code to satisfy the requirements described below.

## Introduction

The goal here is to work on a small projects where you can practice the concepts we've learned thus far.

## Starter Code

To generate the starter code, follow the steps given below

- To create a new application,
    - Open your ubuntu or cmd terminal and execute the following command
      - ```ng new app-name```
      - for example, ng new super-wars
    - To create a new component, execute the command 
      - ``` ng generate component component-name```
      - example, ng generate component contacts
      
## How to run

- To run the project go to your ubuntu terminal or VScode editor
    - open the ubuntu or cmd terminal or inside the vscode editor
    - run the command following command
    - ```ng serve --open or ng serve -o```
    
    
## PROGRESSION #1: Layout

In the project, we are going to create a testimonial with your experience. We are going to create two different components:

- The `MainComponent` component will contain the article image, composed of a `title`, an `image`, and a `description`.
- The `TestimonialComponent` component, that will contain several testimonials (feel free to add as many testimonial as you want).

At the bottom of the testimonial, we will add a testimonial form to add some reality to our article. We can't have testimonial without a form! (Don't worry, it doesn't need to work.  We will get to that later).

The first thing you will have to do is to generate the project with `Angular CLI`.
